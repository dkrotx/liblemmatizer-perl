FAQ
---

1. Is Lemmatizer supports UTF-8?
   Lemmatizer itself (AOT library) doesn't support UTF-8. It's pure CP1251 by historical reasons.
   But for nowadays it's impossible to ignore Unicode. So, the wrapper around Lemmatizer library (LemInterface)
   provides transparent encoding to and from "CP1251".

   Perl interface to Lemmatizer suppose to be UTF-8 only.
   (actually it can use CP1251, but I didn't provide this option)

2. Which languages are supported By lemmatizer?
   Russian and English
